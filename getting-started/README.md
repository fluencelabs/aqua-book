# Getting Started

[Aqua](https://github.com/fluencelabs/aqua), part of Fluence Lab's Aquamarine Web3 stack, is a purpose-built language to program peer-to-peer networks and compose distributed services hosted on peer-to-peer nodes into applications and backends. 

In addition to the language specification, Aqua provides a compiler, which produces Aqua Intermediary Representation \(AIR\) and an execution stack, Aqua VM, that is part of every Fluence node implementation to execute AIR.
