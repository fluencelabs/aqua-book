# Execution flow

Aqua's main goal is to express how the execution flows: moves from peer to peer, forks to parallel flows and then joins back, uses data from one step in another.

As the foundation of Aqua is based on Ï€-calculus, finally flow is decomposed into sequential \(`seq`, `.`\), conditional \(`xor`, `+`\), parallel \(`par`, `|`\) computations and iterations based on data \(`!P`\).
