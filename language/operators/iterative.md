# Iterative

Ï€-calculus has a notion of repetitive process: `!P = P | !P`. That means, you can always fork a new `P` process if you need it.

In Aqua, two operations corresponds to it: you can call a service function \(it's just available when it's needed\), and you can use `for` loop to iterate on collections.

### For expression

In short, `for` looks like the following:

```text
xs: []string

for x <- xs:
  y <- foo(x)
  
-- x and y are not accessible there, you can even redefine them
x <- bar()
y <- baz()  
```

### Contract

Iterations of `for` loop are executed sequentially by default.

Variables defined inside for loop are not available outside.

For loop's code has access to all variables above.

For can be executed on a variable of any [Collection type](../types.md#collection-types).

### Conditional for

You can make several trials in a loop, and break once any trial succeeded.

```text
xs: []string

for x <- xs try:
  -- Will stop trying once foo succeeds
  foo(x)
```

Contract is changed as in [Parallel](parallel.md#contract) flow.

### Parallel for

Running many operations in parallel is the most commonly used pattern for `for`.

```text
xs: []string

for x <- xs par:
  on x:
    foo()
    
-- Once the fastest x succeeds, execution continues
-- If you want to make the subsequent execution independent from for,
-- mark it with par, e.g.:
par continueWithBaz()        
```

Contract is changed as in [Conditional](conditional.md#contract) flow.

### Export data from for

The way to export data from `for` is the same as in [Conditional return](conditional.md#conditional-return) and [Race patterns](parallel.md#join-behavior).

```text
xs: []string
return: *string

-- can be par, try, or nothing
for x <- xs par:
  on x:
    return <- foo()
    
-- Wait for 6 fastest results -- see Join behavior    
baz(return!5, return)    
```

### For on streams

For on streams is one of the most complex parts of Aqua.

Stream forms CRDT.

Iterations are added when new values are added to a stream.
