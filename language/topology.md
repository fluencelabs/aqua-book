# Topology

In Aqua, topology is the major thing. Aqua lets developers to describe the whole distributed workflow in a single script, link data, recover from errors, implement complex patterns like backpressure, and more.

Topology in Aqua is made declarative way. You need just to say where a piece of code must be executed, on what peer, and optionally â€“ how to get there. Compiler will add all the required network hops.

### On expression

`on` expression moves execution to the peer:

```text
on "my peer":
  foo()
```

Foo is instructed to be executed on a peer with id `my peer`. `on` supports variables of type `string` :

```text
-- Foo, bar, baz are instructed to be executed on myPeer
on myPeer:
  foo()
  bar()
  baz()
```

### `%init_peer_id%`

There's one custom peer ID that's always available in scope: `%init_peer_id%`. It points to the peer who initiated this request. But using `on %init_peer_id%` is an anti-pattern: there's no way to ensure that init peer is accessible from the part of the network you're currently in.

More complex scenarios

Consider this example:

```text
func foo():
  on "peer foo":
    do_foo()
    
func bar(i: i32):
  do_bar()
  
func baz():
  bar(1)
  on "peer baz":
    foo()
    bar(2)
  bar(3)            
```

Take a minute to think about:

* Where `do_foo` is executed?
* Where `bar(1)` is executed?
* On what node `bar(2)` runs?
* What about `bar(3)`?

Declarative topology definition always work the same way.

* `dofoo` is executed on "peer foo", always.
* `bar(1)` is executed on the same node where `baz` was running. If `baz` is the first called function, then it's `init peer id`.
* `bar(2)` is executed on `"peer baz"`, despite the fact that foo does topologic transition. `bar(2)` is in the scope of `"peer baz"`, so it will be executed there
* `bar(3)` is executed where `bar(1)` was: in the root scope of `baz`, wherever it was called

### Accessing peers `via` other peers

In the distributed network it's a very common situation when a peer is only accessible indirectly. For example, a browser: it has no public network interface, you cannot open a socket to a browser at will. This leads to a `relay` pattern: there should be a well connected peer that relays requests from a peer to the network and vice versa.

Relays are handled with `via`:

```text
-- When we go to some peer and from some peer,
-- compiler will add an additional hop to some relay
on "some peer" via "some relay":
  foo()
  
-- More complex path: first go to relay2, then to relay1,
-- then to peer. When going out of peer, do it reversed way  
on "peer" via relay1 via relay2:
  foo()
  
-- You can pass any collection of strings to relay,
-- and it will go through it if it's defined,
-- or directly if not  
func doViaRelayMaybe(peer: string, relayMaybe: ?string):
  on peer via relayMaybe:
    foo()
```
